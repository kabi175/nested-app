  "Understanding Mutual Funds": [
    {
      question: "What is a mutual fund?",
      answer:
        "A mutual fund pools money from many investors and invests it in stocks, bonds, or a mix of assets. Professional fund managers handle everything, so you don't need to pick individual shares.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is it different from a bank FD or savings account?",
      answer:
        "FDs offer fixed but lower returns. Mutual funds can deliver higher long-term growth, though returns aren't guaranteed.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do I need to start?",
      answer:
        "You can begin with as little as ₹500–₹1,000 per month through an SIP.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I invest all at once or monthly?",
      answer:
        "Both are possible. SIPs help average out costs and build disciplined savings.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are mutual funds safe? Can I lose money?",
      answer:
        "They're SEBI-regulated. Values fluctuate with the market, but staying invested for 7–10 years usually delivers steady growth.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there extra fees?",
      answer:
        "Funds charge a small expense ratio. Our app does not add any extra fees.",
    },
    {
      question: "How fast can I withdraw money?",
      answer: "Typically within 2–3 working days.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are returns guaranteed?",
      answer:
        "No. But historically, equity funds have outperformed FDs, gold, and real estate over the long term.",
    },
  ],
  "Investing for Your Child's Education": [
    {
      question: "Why start early?",
      answer:
        "Education costs rise sharply each year. Early investing allows your money to compound, reducing the burden later.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I save?",
      answer:
        "Our app projects future education costs, suggests a monthly SIP, and automatically reduces risk as the goal nears.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can the app plan monthly investments for me?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Just enter your child's age, education type, and today's costs — we'll calculate the SIP.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I track progress?",
      answer: "Yes, our goal tracker shows how close you are to your target.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set up separate goals for multiple children?",
      answer: "Yes, each child can have a dedicated portfolio and tracker.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my child's plans change?",
      answer:
        "Update the goal anytime — the app recalculates and shows how much to adjust.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pause or increase my SIP?",
      answer:
        "Yes. SIPs are fully flexible — pause, stop, or raise them anytime.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why not just invest through my existing account?",
      answer:
        "Education is a specific goal. A separate account ensures accurate cost projections and fund allocation for your child's future.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is tax handled?",
      answer:
        "Depends on fund type and holding period. Equity funds held for over a year are taxed at 12.5% on gains above ₹1 lakh.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I withdraw anytime?",
      answer:
        "Yes, unless you've chosen a lock-in product like ELSS (we don't recommend these for education goals).",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need money earlier?",
      answer: "You can redeem partially or fully at any time.",
    },
  ],
  "Trust & Safety": [
    {
      question: "Are these funds SEBI/AMFI-registered?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Every fund on our platform is SEBI-approved and follows AMFI guidelines.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who owns the investments – me or my child?",
      answer:
        "If the account is in your name, you own it. Minor accounts stay under your guardianship until the child turns 18.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are fund recommendations unbiased?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Suggestions are based solely on your goals and SEBI-defined fund categories — not commissions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I invest in any AMC?",
      answer: "Yes, you can access all SEBI-registered AMCs in India.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will the app remind me about SIPs or milestones?",
      answer: "Yes, you'll receive timely reminders and progress updates.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if the app shuts down?",
      answer:
        "Your money remains with the AMC. You can always access it directly via CAMS or KFintech.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the app SEBI-registered?",
      answer: "Yes. We are fully compliant and SEBI / AMFI registered.",
    },
  ],
  "How Nested Helps": [
    {
      question: "How does Nested add value?",
      answer:
        "We start by estimating future education costs and adjust if fees change. Then, we design a portfolio tailored to your timeline and risk profile, while tracking if you're on course.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Nested different?",
      answer:
        'We don\'t push "top" or "trending" funds. Every recommendation is goal-based. We also guide timely reallocation — for example, if you\'ve reached 95% of your goal with just two years left, we\'ll prompt you to shift from equities to safer debt funds.',
    },
    {
      question: "How do you construct portfolio?",
      answer:
        "We carefully mutual funds with a long track record, strong performance, and better risk-adjusted returns. Every six months, we review and refresh our selection to keep it relevant. Your portfolio is then diversified across equity, debt, gold, and silver, with allocations adjusted to market conditions. As you get closer to the goal we dynamically balance allocation less towards equity and more towards less volatile assets. This way, you get a portfolio that's balanced, resilient, and designed to steadily grow with your investment goals.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the fees?",
      answer:
        "Nested is free for you. We earn standard mutual fund commissions from AMCs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Aren't regular funds more expensive?",
      answer:
        "Yes, regular funds cost ~0.60% more on average than direct funds. But our curated portfolios and smart allocation typically deliver returns that outweigh the extra cost. We disclose the difference between regular and direct funds upfront before you invest.",
    },
  ],
